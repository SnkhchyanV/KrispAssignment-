Hey there, this is Krisp's assignment solution for the Associate Data Engineer position by Vladimer Snkhchyans.

The repository contains two directories according to the assignment parts:

RecommendationSystemApp: Contains the code for part one. It's a recommendation system with several services (each with its own directory).

Part2: Contains a Colab file with all the code samples, including filled gaps. You can also find the same Colab file here:
